</p>s

The Email Microservice operates within the following context:

- **Client Applications**: Services that need to send emails
- **Email Providers**: External services (Gmail, Outlook, SMTP servers)
- **Users**: Administrators who manage email accounts and monitor the system
- **Database**: Persistent storage for accounts, quotas, and logs
- **Message Queue**: Ensures reliable asynchronous processing

## 4. Data Models

### 4.1 Core Entities

#### 4.1.1 EmailAccount

```
{
  id: UUID,
  tenantId: string,
  userId: string,
  provider: enum(GMAIL|OUTLOOK|SMTP),
  email: string,
  credentials: {
    accessToken: string,
    refreshToken: string,
    expiresAt: timestamp
  },
  quotaSettings: {
    dailyLimit: number,
    warmupStep: number,
    maxLimit: number,
    currentStage: number
  },
  status: enum(ACTIVE|INACTIVE|WARMING_UP)
}
```

#### 4.1.2 SendEmailEvent

```
{
  id: UUID,
  toAddress: string,
  tenantId: string,
  userId: string,
  subject: string,
  body: string,
  metadata: {
    priority: enum(HIGH|NORMAL|LOW),
    attachments: Array<Attachment>,
    replyTo: string,
    cc: Array<string>,
    bcc: Array<string>
  },
  retryCount: number,
  status: string
}
```

#### 4.1.3 QuotaUsage

```
{
  accountId: UUID,
  date: string,
  sent: number,
  failed: number,
  remaining: number
}
```

#### 4.1.4 EmailLog

```
{
  id: UUID,
  eventId: UUID,
  tenantId: string,
  userId: string,
  fromEmail: string,
  toEmail: string,
  subject: string,
  timestamp: Date,
  status: enum(QUEUED|PROCESSING|SENT|FAILED|REJECTED|REQUEUED),
  statusDetails: string,
  providerResponse: JSON
}
```

### 4.2 Database Schema

## 5. Process Flows

### 5.1 Email Sending Flow

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x600.png?text=Email+Sending+Flow" alt="Email Sending Flow" width="800">
</p>

1. Client sends email request to API
2. API publishes SendEmail event to queue
3. Email Processor consumes the event
4. Processor resolves and validates the recipient address
5. If address is invalid or disposable, reject the email
6. Check email quota availability
7. If quota exceeded, requeue with delay
8. Select appropriate provider and send email
9. Log result and update quota usage
10. Acknowledge or requeue the message based on result

### 5.2 OAuth Connection Flow

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x500.png?text=OAuth+Connection+Flow" alt="OAuth Connection Flow" width="800">
</p>

1. User initiates OAuth flow from frontend
2. API redirects to provider's authorization page
3. User grants permissions
4. Provider redirects back with authorization code
5. API exchanges code for access and refresh tokens
6. API creates or updates email account with tokens
7. Frontend displays success and account details

### 5.3 Email Warmup Strategy

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400.png?text=Email+Warmup+Strategy" alt="Email Warmup Strategy" width="800">
</p>

1. New accounts start with low daily limit (default: 50)
2. Each warmup stage increases quota by configured step (default: 10)
3. System tracks consistent usage
4. When 80% of quota is consistently used, advance to next stage
5. Continue until maximum limit is reached (default: 500)
6. Account status changes from WARMING_UP to ACTIVE

## 6. Technical Considerations

### 6.1 Scalability

The system is designed for horizontal scalability:

- Stateless API servers can be scaled independently
- Multiple Email Processors can run in parallel
- Database connection pooling manages database load
- Queue system handles distribution of workload

### 6.2 Security

Security measures include:

- API key authentication for all endpoints
- Encryption of sensitive credentials
- OAuth for secure provider authorization
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Minimal permission scopes for OAuth tokens

### 6.3 Resilience

Failure handling mechanisms:

- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Dead-letter queue for failed messages
- Circuit breakers for provider failures
- Automatic token refresh for expired credentials
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### 6.4 Monitoring and Observability

Monitoring capabilities:

- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Queue metrics (length, processing time)
- Database performance monitoring
- Provider-specific metrics
- API response times and error rates

## 7. Deployment Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x500.png?text=Deployment+Architecture" alt="Deployment Architecture" width="800">
</p>

### 7.1 Docker-based Deployment

The system can be deployed using Docker Compose with:

- API service container
- Multiple Email Processor containers
- PostgreSQL container
- RabbitMQ container
- Frontend container with Nginx

### 7.2 Kubernetes Deployment

For production environments, Kubernetes deployment includes:

- API Deployment with HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)
- Email Processor Deployment with HPA
- PostgreSQL StatefulSet with persistent volumes

## 9. Performance Considerations

### 9.1 Throughput

Projected performance metrics:

- Single Email Processor: ~10-20 emails/second
- Scaled deployment: 500+ emails/second
- API throughput: 1000+ requests/second

### 9.2 Bottlenecks

Potential bottlenecks and mitigation:

- Provider rate limits: Use multiple accounts
- Database contention: Connection pooling and efficient queries
- Queue processing: Horizontal scaling of processors
- Network latency: Regional deployments

## 10. Future Extensions

Planned future capabilities:

- Additional email providers
- Template management
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- A/B testing capabilities
- Bounce and feedback processing
- Scheduled/recurring emails
- Email campaign management

## 11. Conclusion

The Email Microservice provides a robust, scalable solution for email delivery with a focus on reliability, observability, and maintainability. The architecture enables easy extension and adaptation to changing requirements while ensuring consistent email delivery across multiple providers.
